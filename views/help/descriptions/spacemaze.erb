<div class="game-description">
	A 2D side scrolling space shooting game with a built in level editor!<br/><br/>

	4 built in mazes with 4 bosses. Not very challenging but can serve as a good time waster. You can even try your hand at the level editor if you are feeling adventurous. I made it for myself and thought it would be cool to include it with the game.<br/><br/>

	With a firm grasp of Javascript and the Canvas API, I set forth to produce something with more substance than my previous attempt. The game logic is quite simple, nothing to interesting there. The real work of this project is in the level editor, a feature that I have always enjoyed in the few games that include it.<br/><br/>

	This time I even hired a couple of people to produce graphics and sound, skills that exceed my own capacity.
